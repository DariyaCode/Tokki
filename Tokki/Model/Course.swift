    Course(title: "Korean First-Date with history", subtitle: "Where are the history beggin?", text: "Korean, one of the oldest languages in the world, has a rich history dating back thousands of years. Its origins are attributed to Altaic languages such as Mongolian and Turkic. However, over the centuries, the Korean language has been influenced by Chinese culture and writing. It is important to note that during various periods of Korean history, including the times of the Three Kingdoms (57 BCE-668 CE) and Goguryeo (37 BCE-668 CE), the Korean language has been shaped and developed, enriched with new linguistic elements. During the Three Kingdoms era, the territory of modern Korea was divided into three states: Goguryeo (Goguryeo), Baekgyo (Baekgyo), and Silla (Shilla). During this period, the Korean language began its journey toward stabilization and development as a distinct linguistic pattern. It was a time of active exchange of cultural and linguistic influences with neighboring powers, including China and Japan. One of the most important events that shaped the character of the Korean language was the creation of Hangul in the 15th century during the reign of King Seungdeok. Hangul was created to give the Korean people access to writing without the need to use Chinese characters, which greatly simplified education and allowed Koreans to become more familiar with writing. After the unification of Korea into a single state in 668 A.D. by the Silla Dynasty, the Korean language continued its development while maintaining its uniqueness and identity. During this period, the first written works in Korean, such as poems, chronicles, and historical documents, began to appear, helping to spread the language among the population. In the following centuries, the Korean language continued to evolve under the influence of various historical events, including invasions and occupations by China and Japan. However, despite these external influences, the Korean language remained a key element of the national identity and cultural heritage of the Korean people. As a result of all these historical changes and influences, the Korean language has become what we see today - a rich, expressive and unique language that continues to attract attention and interest both at home and abroad.

    Course(title: "Features of the Korean alphabet", subtitle: "Where are the beggin?", text: "The Korean alphabet, known as Hangul, represents one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of world writing. Created in the 15th century by King Sejong the Great and his learned advisors, Hangul was designed to simplify the writing system and make it accessible to all segments of Korean society. Prior to this, Koreans used Chinese characters, which were difficult to learn and understand, especially for the common people. The introduction of Hangul revolutionized Korean culture and education.  One of the unique features of Hangul is its phonetic nature. Unlike logographic systems such as Chinese characters, where each character represents a word or concept, Hangul is made up of individual letters, each representing a specific sound. This makes it much easier and more logical to learn and use. Hangul consists of 24 basic letters: 14 consonants and 10 vowels. However, what makes it even more amazing is the way these letters combine with each other to form syllables. Each syllable in Hangul consists of one or more letters that combine to form a square structure reminiscent of Chinese characters. This preserves the visual aesthetics of traditional Oriental scripts while providing the simplicity and flexibility of a phonetic alphabet. For example, the syllable 가 consists of the consonant ㄱ (k) and the vowel ㅏ (a). This structure allows Korean to be both visually appealing and easy to read and write. Another significant feature of Hangul is that it is systematic and scientifically sound. The creators of the alphabet strived to make it as logical and accessible to everyone as possible. Each letter of Hangul was designed with the anatomy of the human speech apparatus in mind. For example, the shape of the consonant ㄱ symbolizes the back of the tongue rising to the soft palate, while the letter ㅅ resembles the shape of the teeth encountered when pronouncing the s sound. Another important characteristic of Hangul is its ability to adapt and expand. Even though Hangul was created in the 15th century, it continues to evolve and adapt to changes in Korean language and culture. Modern Korean includes borrowed words and terms from other languages such as English, and Hangul effectively adapts to these changes. This makes it a living and dynamic tool that continues to serve the Korean people today. Hangul also plays a key role in strengthening Korea's national identity and cultural heritage. Its creation symbolizes the Korean people's desire for independence and identity. The introduction of Hangul was not only a linguistic act, but also a social and political act to increase literacy and education among all segments of the population. This aspect of Hangul continues to be important today as Korean culture and language attract increasing attention in the international arena. Thus, the Korean Hangul alphabet is not just a writing system, but a cultural phenomenon that reflects the historical, social, and linguistic characteristics of the Korean people. Its unique features and advantages make it one of the most interesting and innovative alphabets in the world, worthy of deep study and admiration.", image: "Illustration 5", background: "Background 9", logo: "Taught Dariya Gecher"),
    Course(title: "The most popular Korean grammars", subtitle: "Where are the gramma beggin?", text: "Korean, one of the oldest and richest languages in the world, offers a unique and complex grammatical structure that is of interest to linguists and students. Korean grammar differs from many European languages in its syntax, morphology, and use of particles. One of the basic elements of Korean grammar is word order. Korean uses the SOV (subject - complement - predicate) structure, which means that the predicate is always at the end of the sentence. For example, the sentence I am reading a book in Korean would sound like 나는 책을 읽어요 (Naneun chaekeul ilgeoyo), where 나는 (I), 책을 (book) and 읽어요 (read). One of the key aspects of Korean grammar is the use of particles, which indicate the grammatical functions of words in a sentence. For example, the particle 는/은 (neun/eun) is used to indicate the subject and 을/를 (eul/reul) is used to indicate the complement. These particles can also vary according to the harmony of sounds and ease of pronunciation. This use of particles makes the Korean language flexible and allows for more precise expression of thoughts and feelings. Korean verbs also play an important role in grammar. They vary according to tense, aspect, collocation, and level of politeness. Politeness and formality are important aspects of the Korean language. There are several levels of politeness, and choosing the right level depends on the social status and the relationship between interlocutors. For example, the verb to read can be modified as follows: 읽어요 (ilgeo-yo) is the standard polite form, 읽습니다 (ilgseumnida) is the formal polite form, and 읽어 (ilgeo) is the informal form. Korean grammar also has a system of endings that allows verbs and adjectives to be modified to express different meanings and nuances. These endings can indicate the time of action (past, present, future), aspect of action (completeness, duration), modality (possibility, probability), and other grammatical categories. For example, the ending -었/았- (eoss/ass-) is used to form the past tense, and the ending -겠- (get-) is used to express future tense or intention. Another important feature of Korean grammar is the use of constructions to express complex ideas and actions. For example, the construction -고 있다 (-go itda) is used to indicate the duration of an action, similar to English Present Continuous. The phrase I am reading a book would be translated as 나는 책을 읽고 있어요 (Naneun chaekeul ilkgo isseoyo). Similarly, the construction -아/어/여야 하다 (-a/eo/yeo ya hada) is used to express obligation or necessity, as in English must or have to. Among the many teaching materials on Korean grammar, several resources have become particularly popular. One is Korean Grammar in Use, a series of textbooks covering various levels of language proficiency, from beginner to advanced. These books offer a structured approach to learning grammar with plenty of examples and exercises. Also noteworthy is Tolkovyy slovar grammatiki koreyskogo yazyka from Darakwon Publishing, which provides detailed explanations of grammatical rules and constructions. These learning materials help students better understand the complex structure of the Korean language and successfully apply their knowledge in practice. Despite its complexity, Korean grammar offers rich opportunities for expressing thought and emotion, which makes learning this language fun and rewarding.", image: "Illustration 5", background: "Background 9", logo: "Taught Dariya Gecher"),
    Course(title: "K-dramas, or Korean television series, have long become a cultural phenomenon", subtitle: "Where are the K-dramas beggin?", text: "K-dramas, or Korean television series, have long become a cultural phenomenon, attracting viewers worldwide with their captivating plots, vibrant characters, and emotional dialogues. One of the reasons for their popularity is the use of memorable phrases that penetrate everyday life and become part of fans' speech. These phrases often reflect cultural characteristics and the emotional states of the characters, making K-dramas unique and appealing. One of the most famous and frequently used phrases in K-dramas is 사랑해, which means I love you. This phrase is heard in romantic scenes and expresses the characters' deep feelings, becoming a symbol of love and affection. Phrases like 사랑해 contribute to the popularization of the Korean language and culture beyond Korea. Another popular phrase is 화이팅, used for support and motivation. It is equivalent to English phrases like come on or you can do it and is often heard in scenes where characters face difficulties or stress. 화이팅 emphasizes the importance of support and self-belief, making this phrase particularly popular among viewers. The phrase 잘 자, which means good night, is also often used in K-dramas. It expresses care and attention to the interlocutor, creating an atmosphere of coziness and warmth. Such phrases help viewers immerse themselves in the series' atmosphere and feel like part of the characters' world. Many phrases from K-dramas are also related to apologies and expressions of regret. For example, the phrase 미안해, which means sorry, is often used in situations where characters want to atone for their guilt or express regret for their actions. This phrase underscores the importance of forgiveness and sincerity in relationships. The phrase 감사합니다, which means thank you, is another key phrase frequently heard in K-dramas. It expresses gratitude and appreciation, highlighting politeness and respect in Korean culture. 감사합니다 is used in various situations, from simple expressions of thanks to deep acknowledgments of merit. In K-dramas, you can also hear phrases related to relationships and social interactions. For example, the phrase 오빠, which means older brother, is often used by girls to address older men with whom they have close relationships. This word reflects Korea's cultural norms and traditions, emphasizing respect and closeness in relationships. The phrase 행운을 빌어요, which means good luck, is also popular in K-dramas. It is used to wish success and good fortune in various situations, highlighting support and a positive attitude towards others. These and many other phrases from Korean dramas not only make dialogues more lively and emotional but also contribute to spreading the Korean language and culture worldwide.

As a result, K-dramas become an important cultural bridge, connecting people from different countries and cultures through language and shared emotions.", image: "Illustration 5", background: "Background 9", logo: "Taught Dariya Gecher"),
